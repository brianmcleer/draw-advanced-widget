- **Authors:** Brian McLeer (City of Grand Junction, CO) and Jeffrey Thompson (City of Arlington, TX)
- **Built and tested on:** ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition 1.19 and 1.20
- **Minimum supported:** Developer Edition 1.17 (Enterprise 11.5)

> The widget folder itself lives in [`draw-advanced/`](draw-advanced). This repo wraps it with project files (license, this readme) so it works for both downloading a release and cloning.

## Getting the widget

There are two ways to get it. Both end with you placing a `draw-advanced` folder into your Experience Builder install.

### Option 1: Download a release (recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/brianmcleer/draw-advanced-widget/releases) page.
2. Under the latest release, download the `draw-advanced.zip` asset.
3. Extract it. You will get a `draw-advanced` folder.

### Option 2: Clone or download the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brianmcleer/draw-advanced-widget.git
```

Or use the green **Code** button above and choose **Download ZIP**. The `draw-advanced` folder is inside.

## Installation

1. Copy the `draw-advanced` folder into your Experience Builder install:

   ```
   <ArcGISExperienceBuilder>/client/your-extensions/widgets/draw-advanced
   ```

   Keep `manifest.json` directly inside `draw-advanced/`, not nested a second level deep. Nesting is the usual cause of the widget not registering.

2. From the Experience Builder **client** directory, run the standard install:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Because the widget includes a `package.json` and `package-lock.json` and lives in `your-extensions`, Experience Builder installs its dependencies automatically. You do not install shp-write, shpjs, or jszip by hand.

3. Start (or restart) the client and refresh the Builder window. The widget appears under **Insert Widget > Custom**.

> If you add the widget to an Experience Builder that is already running, re-run the client install and restart the dev server so the new dependencies are picked up.

## Requirements

- ArcGIS Experience Builder Developer Edition 1.17 or later, with 1.19 and 1.20 being the build/test targets.
- The measurement functions use ArcGIS Maps SDK 4.32 features, so editions earlier than 1.17 are not supported.

Dependencies (installed automatically, pinned in `draw-advanced/package-lock.json`): `@mapbox/shp-write`, `shpjs`, `jszip`. `proj4` and `seamless-immutable` resolve from the SDK and the jimu framework.

## Features

- Drawing tools for point, line, freehand line, text, rectangle, polygon, freehand polygon, circle, and an optional triangle tool, plus optional curve tools enabled in the widget settings.
- Real-time measurement (area, perimeter, length, radius, coordinates) with geodetic or planar calculation, custom units, per-segment labels, and configurable precision.
- Live tooltips, multi-layer snapping with a 15 pixel tolerance, and an optional alignment grid.
- Buffers (with outline-only and independent custom fill/outline colors), line arrows, an expanded text-styling tool, and drawing-layer management.
- A My Drawings manager: local-storage save, sorting, filtering, locking, notes, undo/redo, bulk operations, and draw-order control.
- Import and export across GeoJSON, KML, zipped shapefile, and legacy JSON, plus EB Draw widget compatible JSON.
- Optional integration with the Mailing Labels and Identify By Query custom widgets.
- Configurable settings: per-tool and per-feature toggles, default buffer and measurement options, and XML import/export to copy a configuration between applications.

See [`draw-advanced/README.md`](draw-advanced/README.md) for the full feature reference, known issues, and changelog.
